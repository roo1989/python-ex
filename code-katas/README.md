## Code Katas and Exercises


# Descriptions
In here you can find my solutions to (almost) daily exercises I do for practice and to learn new things.

This is a very mixed repo, in the folders you can find anything from code katas to examples from a book I'm reading or a new language/framework I'm testing out.

# Layout
These are most as of yet in Python3.7. The folders and modules are marked per date eg. ``` 02.08.2020_``` is from 2th of August 2020.
